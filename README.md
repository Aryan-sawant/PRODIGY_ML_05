# Food Item Recognition with CNN

![Food Item Recognition Demo]

## Overview

Welcome to the Food Item Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! This repository contains the code and resources for training a CNN model to recognize various food items from images and predict their calorie content using TensorFlow's Keras layers and OpenCV for computer vision.

**Key Features:**
- Accurate food item recognition.
- Calorie prediction for recognized food items.
- Easy-to-use Python scripts for training and inference.
- TensorFlow-based model architecture.
- Utilizes OpenCV for image preprocessing.
